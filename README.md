`datascope-tools` consists of a collection of scripts, tools, and
ideas that we have collected over the years at
[Datascope Analytics](http://datascopeanalytics.com) that help with
our workflow and some very basic command-line data analysis.

This is somewhat inspired by
[bit.ly's data_hacks](https://github.com/bitly/data_hacks)

[scripts] datascope-tools
=========================

* `pair-with`: simple script to manipulate `.hg/hgrc` files when
  pairing with other people

* `decrapify`: simple script to remove junk files that commonly occur when
  we're writing code or experimenting with scripts
